# DrugDisc

This project revolved around computational drug discovery. Computational strategies have been used to expedite and reduce cost of the process of drug discovery by identification of lead compounds that have strong affinity for their respective target molecules. 

This project will use different machine techniques to build both a predictive and generative model for drugs that target lung carcinomas. In this project, three elaborate stages have been computationally represented: the generation of novel molecules, the prediction and calculation of molecular properties, and the classification of these molecules as active or not active with respect to the target molecule.  Each of these stages was accomplished by the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Rdkit  libraries, and Random Forest respectively.

This project marks on important step in the direction of reducing the time used in searching through the vast possible space of potential drug-like compounds; instead, machine learning can lead to ranking compounds (generated by sampling from the latent space of the distribution of known drugs) and give us a more accurate guess as to whether or not the generated drug can be used against a particular disease through its predictive capabilities.
